F*EX (File EXchange) is a service to send big (large, huge, giant, ...) files
from sender user A to recipient user B by HTTP.

Sender and recipient user must have an e-mail-address and a web-browser, 
that is all (for them).

The sender uploads the file to the F*EX-server and the recipient
automatically gets a notification e-mail with a download-URL.

The sender must have a valid auth-ID, given by the F*EX administrator.

This F*EX distribution contains the F*EX server and the optional client 
programs fexsend, fexget, sexsend, sexget, xx and zz which run on UNIX. 

Simply run "./install", which installs all files into /home/fex/
Then edit /home/fex/lib/fex.ph and set your local config.

Afterwards you can add F*EX users with /home/fex/bin/fac

If you want to upgrade from a previous F*EX version, you also can run
"./install" which is save, because it will not overwrite:
  /home/fex/lib/fex.ph
  /home/fex/lib/fup.pl
  /home/fex/lib/reactivation.txt
  /home/fex/htdocs/index.html
but will create *_new versions of these files which you then can copy manually 
if you want.

See directory doc for more information.

If you have comments, suggestions, requests, etc, send me an e-mail:
framstag@rus.uni-stuttgart.de

Or fex some nice, funny, interesting videos (eg cute pets) to this address :-)
