Prerequisites:
==============

To install the F*EX server, you need a UNIX system with perl, xinetd and
/usr/lib/sendmail (either original or a clone like postfix or exim). 
Your perl must have the following standard core modules:

CGI
CGI::Carp
Digest::MD5
Encode
Fcntl
File::Basename
Getopt::Std
IO::Handle
POSIX

Optional are the non-standard perl modules:

Net::DNS  		(for better domain error handling)
Socket6   		(for ipv6 support)
Net::INET6Glue		(for ipv6 support)
IO::Socket::INET6	(for ipv6 support)

On Debian or Ubuntu Linux simply execute as root:

  apt-get install xinetd perl-modules libnet-dns-perl libnet-inet6glue-perl
  test -x /usr/lib/sendmail || apt-get install postfix

Do not forget to open port 80 on your firewalls and routers for incoming
connections!

To install F*EX, simply run "./install", then edit lib/fex.ph and set your
local config.  If you want to upgrade from a previous F*EX version, you
also can run "./install", no old config files will be overwritten. Also
index.html is kept.
   
Alternativly use "./install -p 8888" to install F*EX on port 8888 instead
on default port 80. 

Run "./install" again for installing optional localizations (languages).

If the install-script does not work for you (no xinetd, no GNU tools, etc)
here is what is to be done manually for installing:

echo "fex 80/tcp" >> /etc/services
echo "fex stream tcp nowait fex /home/fex/bin/fexsrv fexsrv" >> /etc/inetd.conf
# now restart inetd
useradd -s /bin/bash -c "File EXchange" -m fex
pwd # --> FEXSOURCEDIR
su - fex
cd FEXSOURCEDIR
cp -av bin cgi-bin lib etc htdocs doc $HOME
cd $HOME
mkdir spool
chmod 700 spool
vi lib/fex.ph
# set your config
crontab -e
	3 3 * * * exec /home/fex/bin/fex_cleanup

Hints:
======

F*EX runs with its own uid (default: fex), which will be created by the
install script.

F*EX uses a directory (FEXHOME) containing anything needed to run fex.
Default is FEXHOME=/home/fex, the home directory of the "fex" user.

If you want fex to be installed elsewhere create a new "fex" user account
BEFORE running ./install, e.g.:

adduser --system --group \
  --gecos "File EXchange" \
  --home /srv/fex \
  --shell /bin/bash \
  fex
./install

If you run F*EX behind a HTTP reverse proxy, then write to lib/fex.ph :
	$reverse_proxy_ip = 'internal-IP.address.of.proxy';
	$durl = 'http://your.proxy.with.domain/fop';
Be aware that most proxies have a 2 GB file size limit (signed int 32 bit bug)!
Of course you have to configure your reverse proxy correctly, especially
the URL rewrite rules. See the manual of your reverse proxy.
