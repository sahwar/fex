<p>
F*EX (Frams' Fast File EXchange) is a service to send big (large, huge,
giant, ...) files from a user A to a user B.
<p>
The sender uploads the file to the F*EX server using a 
<a href="/fup">WWW upload form</a> and the recipient
automatically gets a notification e-mail with a download-URL. 
<p>

You say:
<blockquote><em>
  Why do I need another service for file transfer?!<br>
  I have e-mail, ftp, ssh and even sendfile!
</em></blockquote>
<p>
I say:
<blockquote><em>
  You still need F*EX :-)
</em></blockquote>
<p>
  
For example, you want to send your friend your last holiday video (1 GB).
You have the following possibilities (and problems):<p>

<ul>
  <li><h3>sending a DVD by postal service</h3><p>
      Out of the question - we live in the year 
      <<my @x=gmtime(time); $x[5]-69;>> 
      after invention of the internet!
      Sending media (hardware) is for grandpas.
      <p>
  <li><h3>using e-mail</h3><p>
      Most e-mail servers have a limit of 10 MB per e-mail and a
      storage-quota of a few 100 MB per user or even less.
      <p>
  <li><h3>uucp</h3><p>
      Why not cuneiform writing on stone plates?
      <p>
  <li><h3>ssh</h3><p>
      You have your friends password or you are willing to give him yours
      - just for a file transfer?
      <p>
  <li><h3>ftp</h3><p>
      <ul>
        <li>Using which ftp server?
        <li>Using which account, which password?
        <li>You do not mind sending unencrypted passwords and files over the insecure internet?
        <li>Your proxy supports passive-ftp?
        <li>In case of anonymous ftp:
          <ul>
            <li>Does it allow 1 GB uploads?
            <li>Does it allow to delete the upload afterwards?
            <li>Who else can download your file?
            <li>Who else can delete your file?
            <li>You have to send your friend the download-URL, he has to
                inform you about the successful download, you have to delete 
                it afterwards.<br>
                All in all: a pain in the ass.
          </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>
  <li><h3>http</h3><p>
      <ul>
        <li>No default upload and user management - must be programmed
        <li>No auto-notification
        <li>No auto-deletion
        <li>Very few http servers can handle files greater than 2 GB
      </ul>
      <p>
  <li><h3><a href ="http://fex.rus.uni-stuttgart.de/saft/">
          sendfile</a></h3><p>
      <ul>
        <li>You run UNIX and have sendfile installed?
        <li>Your recipient runs UNIX and has sendfile installed?
        <li>Neither you nor your recipient has a firewall blocking port 487?
      </ul>
      <p>
  <li><h3>commercial services like DropLoad, ALLPeers, YouSendIt, etc</h3><p>
      <ul>
        <li>What limit do they have (most: &lt; 2 GB)?
        <li>What about security and privacy: will your files be save and secure?
        <li>Are they open source based or closed proprietary?
        <li>Are they accessible with any browser or do you need java, active-X, flash or other evil plugins?
        <li>Will they exist longer than a few months?<br>
           (DropLoad, ALLPeers and drop.io already have terminated their business)
      </ul>
      <p>
</ul>
<p>
If you have answered only once "no" to the questions above, then you need
F*EX.
<p>
<h2>Main features of F*EX</h2>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>file transfer of virtually unlimited file size
  <li>recipient and sender only need an e-mail program and a web browser -
      of any kind, they do not have to install any software
  <li>RESEND and REGET for resuming after link failures at last sent byte
  <li>auto-notification of recipient
  <li>auto-deletion after download
  <li>auto-deletion after expiration date (default: 5 days)
  <li>full-users can create one time upload URLs for foreign users
  <li>full-users can create sub-users, who can send only to this full-user
  <li>full-users can create groups, an analogy to mailing lists, but for files
  <li>maintenance-free: no admin interaction necessary besides creating new F*EX accounts
  <li>Sending to multiple recipients needs storage on the server only once
  <li>F*EX is a HTTP web-service and needs no firewall-tunnels
  <li>support for streams, too
  <li>for real UNIX users, there are the shell programs fexsend and fexget to
      avoid annoying web browser usage
  <li>protocol and source-code free available
</ul>

<h2>Let's talk about SEX</h2>
F*EX has a companion: Stream EXchange (SEX).<p>
You can imagine SEX as network wide UNIX pipes with a relay between.
This can be useful for piping data from user A to user B where A and B cannot
establish a direct connection, but both can connect by HTTP to the
SEX server. For seamless integration into the UNIX tool chain, there are
the shell-tools sexsend and sexget.
<p>
Authentication is the same as with F*EX.
