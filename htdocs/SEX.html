<h1>Stream EXchange (SEX)</h1>

You can imagine SEX as network wide UNIX pipes with a relay between or as
network based FIFOs.<br>
This can be useful for piping data from A to B where
A and B cannot establish a direct connection, but both can connect to the
SEX-server by HTTP.<br>
SEX is a synchronous service in conjuction to F*EX
which is asynchronous.
<p>
For seamless integration into the UNIX tool chain, there are the
shell-tools <a href="download/sex.tar">sexsend and sexget</a>.
<p>
Using web browsers for sexing will not work, because they cannot handle
streams in a pipe. So far, there are only the UNIX clients. Feel free to
implement other clients for other operating systems :-)
<p>
Authentication is the same as with <a href="/">F*EX</a>.
<p>
Example:
<p>
<PRE>
  root@lanldap:/var/log: tail -f syslog | sexsend framstag@rus.uni-stuttgart.de

  framstag@blubb:/tmp: sexget | grep ldap
</PRE>
<p>
If you need encryption, then use the standard UNIX toolbox and add an
appropriate program to the pipe, for example: openssl bf

<h3>public SEX</h3>
The recipient of regular SEX must be a registered F*EX user.<br>
But you can also offer streams to non-registered user.<br>
This is called "<em>public SEX</em>", example:
<p>
<PRE>
  framstag@flupp: cal | sexsend public
  http://fex.rus.uni-stuttgart.de/sex?user=framstag@rus.uni-stuttgart.de&ID=public
  http://fex.rus.uni-stuttgart.de/sex?dXNlcj1mcmFtc3RhZ0BydXMudW5pLXN0dXR0Z2FydC5kZSZJRD1wdWJsaWM=
</PRE>
<p>
sexsend then displays two URLs onder which one can get the stream.

<h3>SEX - all inclusive</h3>
To transfer files by streaming you can use xx-rated SEX:
<p>
<PRE>
  root@vms2:/data/VM# <a href="/download/fuck.tar">sexxx</a> flupp
  streaming:
  flupp/
  flupp/vmware.log
  flupp/flupp.nvram
  flupp/flupp.vmxf
  flupp/flupp.vmx
  flupp/flupp.vmdk
